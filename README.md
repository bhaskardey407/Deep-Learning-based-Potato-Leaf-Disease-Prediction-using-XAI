# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Project
Potato Leaf Disease Detection using the images of potato leaf

Dataset Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arajmishra/potato-dataset

In this Project, first I have built my own CNN model which gave an accuracy of 99.85% to classify the potato leaf diseases based on the image of the potato leaf, then I have used XAI using lime model to mark the areas in the leaf responsible for the particular prediction. At the end I have also used some pre trained CNN models for training, the models along with their accuracy are stated below : 
ResNet50 Model: 99.46%
ResNet152 Model: 99.78%
InceptionV3 Model: 94.81%
VGG16 Model: 99.84%
VGG19 Model: 99.41%
